#### Immunogenicity of Influenza Vaccines: Evidence for Differential Effect of Secondary Vaccination on Humoral and Cellular Immunity

Objective: Assess immunogenicity was performed by measuring
antibody responses and by investigating vaccine-specific T
cell responses
Study Design:	
Study Population:  Public health care workers, ages 18-52. `n = `
Study Period: Two consecutive seasons; (2009-2010, 2010-2011)
Vaccines used: 
-		Fluad: monovalent, MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine (targets HA & NA) in 2009-2010
- 	An unadjuvanted seasonal subunit vaccine w/ pandemic H1N1 strain 2010-2011
